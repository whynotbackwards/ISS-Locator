# ISS Locator

Have you ever wondered if the International Space Station (ISS) is hovering over you? Well now you can be notified whenever it is!

Run this script continuously on a cloud program, such as [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), and it will check every minute to see if the ISS is in the vicinity of coordinates you provide. If it is and it is after sunset (*so you can actually see it*), it will send an email to a specified recipient using your specified credentials. This program will be more useful to night owls.

***Note: Be sure to use an app password given by your email provider so you're not posting your personal password.***
